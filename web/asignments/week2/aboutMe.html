        My name is Shawn Phillips. I am a Computer Science Major and am just about to get into my Senior year of school. I over all hope to one day become
        a developer that builds websites or apps for different companies. I really do not want to be stuck doing the same project for several years. 
        <br><br>
        Some of my hobbies are playing the guitar, programming, reading, watching hockey, and watching TV shows. I really like a good story so anything that has a good 
        story I can get into. 
        <br><br>
        I have been married for 2 years and have a 1 year old son. I always though that when I grew up that I would make decision for myself and realized that
        when you have a kid, they actualy make your decisions. 
        The picture on the right is of my family and I is when we went to watch a hockey game. Our favorite team is the San Jose Sharks and we watched them 
        play that day. That is one of the reasons that the website is teal.
